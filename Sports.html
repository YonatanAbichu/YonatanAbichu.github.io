		<h1>Sports I Love</h1>
		
		<p> During high school I have participated in many sports where some I still take part of today. Freshman and sophmore year I played ultimate frisbee, basketball, and esports. Junior and senior year I played basketball and did track & field. In my free time today I still play basketball with some friends and family because I love both being active and having fun. I try to be involved in almost every activity </p>
